It is brewed in the classic quadrupel style and adheres to the original 1946 recipe.

Did you know that the St.Bernardus on every thousandth label of a 33-centilitre bottle is winking? 

St.Bernardus Abt 12 is a dark beer of top fermentation with a robust head that is ivory in colour. It has a very fruity aroma that is the result of using our own unique yeast. It brims over with different, complex tastes and stands out through its long, bittersweet finish. It is an ideal partner for rich beef dishes and recipes with game. It also forms a perfect match with blue cheese and chocolate.","12oz Draft","19"
