For dishes with spice, an IPA with citrus notes and a crisp finish can be a wonderful choice as it complements and balances spicier flavors. If you're aiming for something with a milder profile, a light and refreshing lager might suit your meal beautifully. We also have a selection of beers at different price points, so let me know if you have a budget in mind. Would you like to explore some of these options further?",

        "expected_output": "I'd be happy to help you find the perfect drink! Do you lean more towards an ale or a stout when enjoying a balanced hop-malt profile? For a mid-priced option, you might enjoy our locally crafted English Pale Ale, which offers a wonderful balance of floral hops and a slightly sweet malt backbone. It's smooth with a touch of caramel, providing a satisfying finish. If you prefer something with richer flavors, our Milk Stout could be an excellent choiceâ€”it boasts creamy textures with hints of chocolate and roasted coffee, making it a comforting option.\n\nBoth would pair nicely with hearty dishes like a beef stew or grilled sausages. Would you like to explore some samples to find your favorite?",
